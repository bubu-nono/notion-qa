BitMart will start the automatic withdrawal process once you confirm to start your withdrawal. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the process once initiated. Due to the anonymity of the blockchain, BitMart is not able to locate where your funds have been sent. If you have sent your coins to a wrong address by mistake. We recommend you to find out who the address belongs to. Contact with the recipient if possible and negotiate to get your funds back.
If you have withdrawn your funds to another exchange with an incorrect or empty tag/required description, please contact the receiving exchange with your TXID to organize the return of your funds.
