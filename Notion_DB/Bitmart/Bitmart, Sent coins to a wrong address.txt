Unfortunately, BitMart won't receive any digital assets if you sent your coins to a wrong address. Also, BitMart does not know who owns these addresses and cannot help to recover these coins.
We recommend you to find out who the address belongs to. Contact with the owner if possible and negotiate to get your coins back.
